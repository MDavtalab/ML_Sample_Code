## 📖 About  
This repository is my personal library of machine learning code implementations, designed as a reference and practice collection.  
It includes various supervised learning algorithms such as **Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Decision Tree**, and more.  

I regularly update this repository with:
- New algorithms  
- Optimization experiments  
- Example datasets  
- Visualization improvements
