This repository is my library of machine learning code implementations, designed as a reference and practice collection.
It includes various supervised learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and more.
Each algorithm is implemented in Python, using clear and well-commented code for easy understanding and reuse.
Most scripts use NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data handling, model training, and visualization.
Example datasets are included or loaded from popular sources to demonstrate how each algorithm works in practice.
This is a living repository â€” I regularly update it with new algorithms, optimizations, and experiments.
It can be useful for beginners learning ML fundamentals, as well as for experienced users looking for quick reference code.
Feel free to fork, modify, and use the code in your own projects under the terms of the license.
Contributions and suggestions are welcome to further improve this library.
