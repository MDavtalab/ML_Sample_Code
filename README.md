## üìñ About  
This repository is my personal library of machine learning code implementations, designed as a reference and practice collection.  
It includes various supervised learning algorithms such as **Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Decision Tree**, and more.  

I regularly update this repository with:
- New algorithms  
- Optimization experiments  
- Example datasets  
- Visualization improvements

## ü§ù Contributing

Feel free to **fork**, modify, and use the code in your own projects.  
Pull requests and suggestions are always welcome to help improve this library.  

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-YourFeatureName`)  
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)  
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-YourFeatureName`)  
5. Open a Pull Request

If you want, I can also **add a GitHub-style table** comparing each algorithm with the dataset used, complexity, and type so your README looks even more professional. That would make your repo look like a mini ML reference hub.
